Updated documentation.
Compatibility updates.

0.6.0:
Added new association test normalisr.association.association_test_5 that uses given mask to determine X-Y pairs in hypothesis tests with multi-variate regression. This option is not yet available on command line.
Refactored normalisr.association, normalisr.de, and normalisr.coex.
Added option 'lowmem' to reduce memory footprint by not returning regression coefficients of covariates.

0.5.0:
Parallelled lcpm
More error messages and documentation
Adding memory efficient options in several functions as the default

Complete revamp of user interface.

0.3.2:
Allows differential and co-expression computation without input covariates (though not recommended).
Added UPDATES file.

0.3.1:
Allows to perform covariate normalization (in normcov) without adding constant 1 covariate. Useful for non-final covariate normalization.
Allows (but not recommended unless for very large datasets) to trade accuracy for speed in normalisr.association.inv_rank and its callers.
Added known issues in README.
Various minor improvments and bug corrections.
